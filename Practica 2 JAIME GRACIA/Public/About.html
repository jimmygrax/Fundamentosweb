            My name is Jaime Gracia Gil and I am from Zaragoza. I have studied at the Montearag√≥n school in Zaragoza all my life. Until I decided to go in the second year of high school to study in the United States,where I have spent all this last year living with a family, I went specifically to a small town in Kansas  where I have had a great time one of the best experiences I've done in my life without doubt, where I managed to learn some English, make friends and have a great time.
         <hr>I also got some things in the field of sports, which for them in schools is a very important thing like qualifying for the state championship in golf I also won several tournaments and was second in my league, in soccer we managed to qualify for the state, but we lost in the semis.<br>  When I finished that year in the U.S. I decided to come to Madrid to study at the UFV and I am living in a college with 160 other people and it is one of the best decisions I have ever made along with going to the U.S. to live for a year.
         <hr>As I have already told you I love sports is one of my favorite hobbies especially with my colleagues paddle tennis and golf, before I played soccer but I stopped playing, in golf I have won many things here in Spain as for example I was champion of Aragon in my category won the tournament Miguel Angel Jimenez absolute this last year was among the top 5 of 150 pairs of Aragon with my father and many more things ....
         <hr>What I like to do the most is hang out with my friends and family in the summers I usually try to do some volunteering, but mostly I dedicate it to partying and spending time with the ones I love the most. I spend my summers in Huelva, Marbella and until last year in Calafell but I travel around Spain with my friends in the summer.
         Apart from the USA I have also been volunteering in various places such as Fatima and Lisbon, Portugal.
         <hr>I am studying bilingual computer engineering at the University Francisco de Vitoria (UFV) at first I did not know if I would be able to do it since I did not do the second year of high school and I had never programmed, and I was worried about my math level beeing low , but so far everything is going well and without any problems.
